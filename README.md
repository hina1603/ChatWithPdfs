The File Chat System is an interactive application that allows users to ask questions based on the contents of various document formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT, DOC). It utilizes multiple AI models (such as Cohere, Dolly, Phi-1_5, Bloomz, and DeepSeek) to provide detailed responses based on the context extracted from the uploaded files.
